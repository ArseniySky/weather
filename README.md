## About

Weather.js was designed to be a conclusive JavaScript weather library built around the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API (no affiliation). Since other providers format their output differently, currently OpenWeatherMap is the only source provider.


Weather.js was originally created by [Noah Smith](https://github.com/noazark) and is currently maintained by [PallasStreams](https://github.com/PallasStreams).

## Testing
To run the JavaScript unit tests run:
```bash
npm run test
```

You can also have the test run automatically when a file changes while developing by running:
```bash
npm run test-watch
```
